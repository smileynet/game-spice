# Game Planning Anti-Patterns

Common mistakes in game planning and how to avoid them.

## Quick Reference

### Top 10 Anti-Patterns

| # | Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Better Approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Everything Sounds Fun | Feature list grows every session | 3-feature MLP rule, parking lot for ideas |
| 2 | Feature Creep | "Small" additions that compound | Each addition goes through cutting heuristics |
| 3 | Scope Creep | Requirements shift mid-build | Freeze scope after planning, track changes explicitly |
| 4 | Premature Content | Building levels before fun is proven | Prove core loop with 1 level, then expand |
| 5 | Design in Isolation | Mechanics designed without playtesting | Paper prototype → digital prototype → playtest loop |
| 6 | Juice Addiction | Polish before fun | Remove all juice — is it still fun? |
| 7 | Kitchen Sink Design | Game tries to do everything | Pick 1-2 target aesthetics, cut the rest |
| 8 | Core Loop Neglect | Building features around a weak loop | If core loop isn't fun in 5 min, fix it first |
| 9 | Second System Effect | Overdesigning based on past project | Scope to current project's needs, not past regrets |
| 10 | GDD Tome | 50+ page design document | Living doc, max 5 pages for MLP scope |

## Decision Tables

### Should I Add This Feature?

Answer each question. If you get any "No" answers, strongly consider cutting.

| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Does it directly serve the core loop? | Keep evaluating | Cut |
| Can the MLP be fun without it? | Defer to post-MLP | Keep evaluating |
| Can it be built in <1 day? | Keep evaluating | Cut from MLP |
| Have playtesters asked for it? | Keep evaluating | Cut |
| Does it require a new system? | Cut from MLP | Keep evaluating |
| Are you adding it because competitors have it? | Cut | Keep evaluating |

**If you reach the bottom with all "Keep evaluating":** The feature is a strong candidate. Add it to MLP only if you're under the 3-feature limit.

### Is My Plan Over-Scoped?

| Signal | Score |
|--------|-------|
| More than 3 features beyond core loop | +2 |
| Any feature described as "simple" without a prototype | +1 |
| Plan mentions more than 2 enemy/item/level types | +1 |
| Multiplayer is included (and isn't the core loop) | +3 |
| Plan requires procedural generation | +2 |
| Total estimated dev time > 4 weeks for solo dev | +2 |
| Plan includes a progression system AND content | +1 |
| Design document is more than 3 pages | +1 |
| You can't describe the game in one sentence | +2 |

| Total Score | Assessment |
|-------------|-----------|
| 0-2 | Scope looks reasonable |
| 3-5 | Over-scoped — cut 30% |
| 6-8 | Significantly over-scoped — cut 50% |
| 9+ | Start over with just the core loop |

## Checklists

### Pre-Planning Review

Run this BEFORE starting detailed planning:

- [ ] Core loop can be stated in one sentence
- [ ] Target aesthetic(s) identified (max 2)
- [ ] Genre precedents researched (what works, what doesn't)
- [ ] Platform constraints known
- [ ] Solo/team capacity honestly assessed
- [ ] Previous project lessons documented (but not over-applied)

### Post-Planning Audit

Run this AFTER planning is complete:

- [ ] MLP has ≤3 features beyond core loop
- [ ] No feature requires "a new system" to support it
- [ ] No premature content (max 1 level, 1-2 enemy types in MLP)
- [ ] 30% rule applied to timeline
- [ ] Every feature passes "Should I Add This Feature?" table
- [ ] Over-scope score is ≤2
- [ ] Plan fits in ≤3 pages
- [ ] First playable build target defined (tracer bullet)
- [ ] Playtest plan exists (who, when, what to test)
- [ ] Parking lot created for deferred ideas
