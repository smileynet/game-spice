# Content & Level Planning

Plan content scope before building. Content is the most expensive part of most games — every hour of content costs many hours to produce.

## Quick Reference

### World Structure Decision

| Structure | Player Freedom | Scope Cost | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Linear** | Low — one path forward | Low | Platformer, puzzle, narrative |
| **Hub-and-spoke** | Medium — choose order within hub | Medium | Zelda-style, RPG, Metroidvania-lite |
| **Open world** | High — go anywhere | Very High | Sandbox, exploration, RPG |
| **Metroidvania** | Medium — gated by abilities | High | Exploration, ability-based progression |
| **Procedural** | Variable | High (to do well) | Roguelike, survival, infinite runners |

**Decision rule:** Choose the lowest-freedom structure that serves your core loop. More freedom = more content to fill the space = more scope.

### Content Scope Estimation

| Content Type | Rough Production Ratio | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Handcrafted level | 10-40 hours per 5 min of play | Includes design, art, testing, iteration |
| Enemy type | 2-5 days each | Design, art, animation, AI, balance |
| Boss encounter | 1-3 weeks each | High-impact but expensive |
| Cutscene/dialogue | 2-8 hours per minute | Writing, implementation, testing |
| Procedural system | Weeks-months upfront | Amortizes over infinite content |

**Key principle:** Content production does not scale linearly. Level 1 takes 2 days. Level 20 takes 2 days. But you need 20x the motivation to build level 20 as level 1. Plan for production fatigue.

### Content Architecture Principle

> Poor tooling makes equivalent content cost 10x more. Invest in content tools proportionally to how much content you'll build — but not before you know WHAT you're building.
