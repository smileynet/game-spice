# Player Motivation

## Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

Three innate psychological needs that drive intrinsic motivation:

| Need | Definition | Game Design Application |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Competence** | Feeling effective and mastering challenges | Clear skill progression, appropriate difficulty, meaningful feedback |
| **Autonomy** | Feeling in control of your choices | Multiple valid strategies, player-driven pacing, meaningful choices |
| **Relatedness** | Feeling connected to others | Co-op, competition, shared experiences, NPCs that feel real |

## Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation

| Type | Driven By | Game Example | Durability |
|------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Intrinsic** | Activity is inherently enjoyable | Playing because combat feels great | Long-lasting |
| **Extrinsic** | External reward for activity | Playing to fill a progress bar | Fades when reward stops |

## The Overjustification Effect

Adding extrinsic rewards to an intrinsically fun activity can **reduce** motivation.

**Warning signs in game design:**
- Players grind unfun content for rewards instead of enjoying gameplay
- Removing daily login rewards causes player drop-off (they weren't playing for fun)
- Players optimize the fun out of your game to maximize reward efficiency

**Guideline:** Extrinsic rewards should amplify intrinsic fun, not replace it. If players wouldn't do the activity without the reward, the activity needs redesign.
