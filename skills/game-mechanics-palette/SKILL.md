name: game-mechanics-palette
description: Curated catalog of game mechanics organized for discovery and creative combination. Use when brainstorming game ideas, exploring what mechanics to include, combining mechanics from different genres, evaluating mechanic compatibility, or building a game concept from scratch. Covers movement, combat, building, collection, cards, management, social, puzzle, temporal, and progression mechanics with mashup patterns and guided exploration prompts.

# Game Mechanics Palette

A vocabulary of game mechanics organized by what the player **does** — for browsing, evaluating, and creatively combining during brainstorming.

## Quick Reference — Mechanics at a Glance

| Category | Core Verbs | Representative Mechanics |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Movement** | Move, jump, traverse | Platforming, flight, teleportation, wall-running, grappling |
| **Combat** | Attack, defend, evade | Melee combo, ranged/projectile, parry/counter, stealth takedown, AoE |
| **Building & Crafting** | Place, construct, shape | Construction, crafting recipes, terraforming, tower placement, automation |
| **Collection & Resource** | Gather, harvest, extract | Looting, fishing, mining, farming, foraging |
| **Cards & Deckbuilding** | Draw, play, build | Draw/play cycles, deck construction, hand management |
| **Management** | Allocate, optimize, direct | City/base building, unit control, scheduling |
| **Social & Negotiation** | Trade, persuade, ally | Trading, diplomacy, recruitment, relationship building |
| **Puzzle & Logic** | Solve, match, deduce | Pattern matching, spatial reasoning, physics manipulation, sequencing |
| **Temporal** | Time, react, sync | Turn-based, real-time with pause, time rewind, rhythm/timing |
| **Progression & Meta** | Unlock, upgrade, evolve | Skill trees, equipment, mutations, roguelike meta-progression |

## Mashup Patterns

Named strategies for combining mechanics from different categories. Each creates a distinct design space.

| Pattern | How It Works | Example Games |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Loop Nesting** | One genre's mechanics as core loop, another's as meta loop | Slay the Spire (roguelike meta + deckbuilder core), FTL (roguelike meta + management core) |
| **Verb + Context Shift** | Familiar mechanic in an unfamiliar setting or genre context | Battle Chef Brigade (cooking + combat), Pyre (basketball + visual novel) |
| **Opposing Forces** | Two mechanics that create natural tension by pulling in opposite directions | Fortnite (building + destruction), MGSV (stealth + loud combat), Subnautica (exploration + survival pressure) |
| **Scale Shift** | Micro-level mechanic applied at macro scale, or vice versa | Into the Breach (puzzle thinking at tactics scale), Katamari (collection at physics-world scale) |
| **System Merger** | Two independent systems that share a scarce resource, forcing trade-offs | Inscryption (deckbuilding + escape room share attention), Hades (combat + relationship building share runs) |
