# Guided Exploration Prompts

Use these prompts to walk through mechanic discovery and combination during brainstorming. Each step builds on the previous.

## 1. Core Verb Discovery

> **"What does the player DO most often? Pick a single verb."**

Start from the action, not the genre. "Jump," "shoot," "build," "match," "trade" — the core verb determines which mechanic categories to browse first. If the user can't pick one verb, they may need to brainstorm the fantasy first (what does the player *feel like*?) and work backward to the verb.

## 2. Palette Browsing

> **"Here are the mechanics in [category]. Which resonate with your vision? Pick 1-3."**

Open the relevant category from the palette `(see game-mechanics-palette/palette.md)`. Don't present all categories — start with the one matching the core verb, then offer one adjacent category for variety. Look at genre origins and system types to find mechanics that share infrastructure.

## 3. Cross-Genre Raid

> **"What's a mechanic from a completely different genre that could add surprise?"**

Pick a category that has zero overlap with the current selections. Present 2-3 mechanics from that category and ask: "What if your [core verb] game also had [unexpected mechanic]?" Use the mashup patterns to frame the combination `(see game-mechanics-palette/mashups.md)`. This is where the most creative ideas emerge.

## 4. Tension Check

> **"Do these mechanics create interesting friction, or do they fight each other?"**

Evaluate the selected mechanics as a set:
- **Good tension:** Mechanics pull in different directions, creating choices (explore vs. survive, build vs. defend)
- **Bad friction:** Mechanics need contradictory player skills or moods (twitch reflexes AND slow deliberation in the same moment)
- **No tension:** Mechanics all reinforce the same thing without trade-offs (power fantasy with no cost)

## 5. Loop Integration

> **"How do these mechanics feed into each other? Can you trace a core loop?"**

Map the mechanics into a loop: Action → Reward → Reinvestment → Action. If a mechanic doesn't connect to the loop, it's a side system — fine for a full game, but cut it for MLP `(see game-design-frameworks → Core Loop Design)`.

## 6. Aesthetic Alignment

> **"Which MDA aesthetics does this combination serve?"**

Check the selected mechanics against the 8 MDA aesthetics `(see game-design-frameworks → MDA Framework)`. A strong combination serves 1-2 aesthetics clearly. If the mechanics point in 4+ aesthetic directions, the game lacks focus — narrow down.
