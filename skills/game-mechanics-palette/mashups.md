# Mashup Pattern Deep Dive

Named strategies for combining mechanics from different categories. Each creates a distinct design space.

## Loop Nesting

The most common mashup — layer a meta-progression structure around a different genre's core gameplay.

**Formula:** [Meta structure] wraps [Core gameplay]
- Roguelike meta + deckbuilding core = Slay the Spire
- Roguelike meta + tactics core = Into the Breach
- Idle meta + RPG core = many idle RPGs
- Campaign meta + puzzle core = Puzzle Quest

**Why it works:** The meta layer provides long-term motivation and variety. The core provides moment-to-moment engagement. Each solves the other's weakness.

**Pitfall:** If the meta layer rewards grinding over skill in the core, players optimize the fun out. Ensure meta-progression expands options, doesn't trivialize the core.

## Verb + Context Shift

Take a well-understood mechanic and drop it into a genre where it doesn't "belong."

**Formula:** [Known mechanic] in [Unexpected context]
- Cooking (crafting) in combat scenarios = Battle Chef Brigade
- Basketball (sports) in narrative RPG = Pyre
- Typing (skill) in horror/action = Typing of the Dead

**Why it works:** Players already know the mechanic, so onboarding is cheap. The new context makes familiar actions feel fresh and creates unexpected dynamics.

**Pitfall:** The shifted mechanic must actually serve the new context. If it feels bolted on rather than integrated, the novelty wears off quickly.

## Opposing Forces

Pair mechanics that inherently conflict — players must constantly balance between them.

**Formula:** [Mechanic A] pulls against [Mechanic B]
- Building (create) vs destruction (threaten) = Fortnite, Minecraft with Creepers
- Stealth (patience) vs action (aggression) = Dishonored, MGSV
- Exploration (wander) vs survival pressure (return to safety) = Subnautica, Don't Starve

**Why it works:** Tension creates interesting decisions. Every moment spent on one mechanic has an opportunity cost in the other. Players develop personal styles based on which side they favor.

**Pitfall:** If one side dominates (stealth is always better than combat, or vice versa), the tension collapses. Balance so both approaches are viable.

## Scale Shift

Apply a mechanic at a different scale than its genre of origin.

**Formula:** [Micro mechanic] at [Macro scale] or [Macro mechanic] at [Micro scale]
- Puzzle solving (micro) at tactics scale (macro) = Into the Breach
- Collection (micro) at world-physics scale (macro) = Katamari Damacy
- City management (macro) at personal/survival scale (micro) = This War of Mine

**Why it works:** The scale change creates novel decision-making. Familiar mechanics feel new when the consequences operate at a different level.

**Pitfall:** The shifted scale must still produce readable feedback. If a micro mechanic scales up but the player can't perceive the consequences (too many units, too slow to see results), the novelty collapses into confusion.

## System Merger

Two systems that could each be their own game share a limited resource (time, currency, attention).

**Formula:** [System A] and [System B] compete for [Shared resource]
- Deckbuilding + escape room share player attention = Inscryption
- Combat + relationship building share run time = Hades
- Farming + dungeon crawling share seasonal time = Stardew Valley (with combat caves)

**Why it works:** The shared resource forces trade-offs that neither system creates alone. Players must decide how much of the scarce resource to invest in each system, creating a meta-strategy layer.

**Pitfall:** If one system is clearly more rewarding than the other, players will ignore the weaker system. Both must provide meaningful returns on investment.
