# MLP Scenario Walkthrough

Narrate the player's experience before writing code. If you can't describe it, you can't build it.

## Quick Reference

### What Is a Scenario Walkthrough?

A moment-by-moment narration of a complete play session through your MLP. Not a feature list — a story of what the player sees, does, and feels from launch to session end.

**Write one when:** Core loop + 3 features are defined, BEFORE implementation begins `(see game-scoping → The 3-Feature Rule)`.

### The 5-Beat Structure

| Beat | Question It Answers | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| **1. First Contact** | What does the player see on launch? | First 10 seconds |
| **2. Learning the Verb** | How do they discover the core mechanic? | First 1-2 minutes |
| **3. Core Loop in Motion** | What does a full loop cycle feel like? | 2-3 cycles |
| **4. Rising Stakes** | How does challenge emerge? | First failure |
| **5. Session End** | Why would they play again? | Last moment |

### Input & Feedback Mapping

For each key moment, fill in this template:

| Player Intent | Input | Visual Feedback | Audio Feedback | State Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *"I want to jump"* | *Space bar* | *Character rises, squash & stretch* | *Whoosh sound* | *Position changes, airborne state* |
| *"I want to attack"* | *Click* | *Sword swing animation, hit flash* | *Slash + impact sound* | *Enemy HP decreases* |

**Rule:** If you can't fill in all 5 columns for a core action, the design isn't concrete enough to build.

### MLP Scenario Checklist

- [ ] First 30 seconds described — what does the player see and do first?
- [ ] First failure described — how does the player lose/fail and what happens?
- [ ] Complete core loop cycle narrated — action → reward → reinvestment
- [ ] Every input method used in MLP is mentioned at least once
- [ ] A reason to replay or continue is present at session end
- [ ] No beat says "the player has fun" — describe what they DO, not how they feel
