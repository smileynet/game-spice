description: Curated catalog of game mechanics organized for discovery and creative combination. Use when brainstorming game ideas, exploring what mechanics to include, combining mechanics from different genres, evaluating mechanic compatibility, or building a game concept from scratch. Covers movement, combat, building, collection, cards, management, social, puzzle, temporal, and progression mechanics with mashup patterns and guided exploration prompts.

# Game Mechanics Palette

A vocabulary of game mechanics organized by what the player **does** — for browsing, evaluating, and creatively combining during brainstorming.

## Quick Reference — Mechanics at a Glance

| Category | Core Verbs | Representative Mechanics |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Movement** | Move, jump, traverse | Platforming, flight, teleportation, wall-running, grappling |
| **Combat** | Attack, defend, evade | Melee combo, ranged/projectile, parry/counter, stealth takedown, AoE |
| **Building & Crafting** | Place, construct, shape | Construction, crafting recipes, terraforming, tower placement, automation |
| **Collection & Resource** | Gather, harvest, extract | Looting, fishing, mining, farming, foraging |
| **Cards & Deckbuilding** | Draw, play, build | Draw/play cycles, deck construction, hand management |
| **Management** | Allocate, optimize, direct | City/base building, unit control, scheduling |
| **Social & Negotiation** | Trade, persuade, ally | Trading, diplomacy, recruitment, relationship building |
| **Puzzle & Logic** | Solve, match, deduce | Pattern matching, spatial reasoning, physics manipulation, sequencing |
| **Temporal** | Time, react, sync | Turn-based, real-time with pause, time rewind, rhythm/timing |
| **Progression & Meta** | Unlock, upgrade, evolve | Skill trees, equipment, mutations, roguelike meta-progression |

## Mashup Patterns

Named strategies for combining mechanics from different categories. Each creates a distinct design space.

| Pattern | How It Works | Example Games |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Loop Nesting** | One genre's mechanics as core loop, another's as meta loop | Slay the Spire (roguelike meta + deckbuilder core), FTL (roguelike meta + management core) |
| **Verb + Context Shift** | Familiar mechanic in an unfamiliar setting or genre context | Battle Chef Brigade (cooking + combat), Pyre (basketball + visual novel) |
| **Opposing Forces** | Two mechanics that create natural tension by pulling in opposite directions | Fortnite (building + destruction), MGSV (stealth + loud combat), Subnautica (exploration + survival pressure) |
| **Scale Shift** | Micro-level mechanic applied at macro scale, or vice versa | Into the Breach (puzzle thinking at tactics scale), Katamari (collection at physics-world scale) |
| **System Merger** | Two independent systems that share a scarce resource, forcing trade-offs | Inscryption (deckbuilding + escape room share attention), Hades (combat + relationship building share runs) |

## Guided Exploration Prompts

Use these prompts to walk through mechanic discovery during brainstorming:

1. **Core Verb Discovery** — "What does the player DO most often? Pick a single verb." Start from the action, not the genre.
2. **Palette Browsing** — "Here are the mechanics in [category]. Which resonate? Pick 1-3." Start with the category matching the core verb, then offer one adjacent category.
3. **Cross-Genre Raid** — "What's a mechanic from a completely different genre that could add surprise?" Pick a category with zero overlap. Use mashup patterns to frame the combination.
4. **Tension Check** — "Do these mechanics create interesting friction, or do they fight each other?" Good tension = choices. Bad friction = contradictory player skills. No tension = power fantasy without cost.
5. **Loop Integration** — "How do these mechanics feed into each other? Can you trace a core loop?" If a mechanic doesn't connect to the loop, cut it for MLP.
6. **Aesthetic Alignment** — "Which MDA aesthetics does this combination serve?" A strong combination serves 1-2 aesthetics. If 4+ directions, narrow down.
