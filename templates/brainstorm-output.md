# <Title> — Design Brief

## Elevator Pitch

<!-- Game name, genre, and one-line concept. 1-3 sentences. -->
<!-- Example: "A roguelike where you grapple through dark procedural caverns, -->
<!-- fighting creatures and collecting upgrades as you descend into the unknown." -->

## Core Loop

<!-- One-sentence core loop using the validation format: -->
<!-- "The player [VERB]s [OBJECT] to [REWARD], which lets them [REINVEST]." -->

<!-- Validation checklist (internal — results summarized here): -->
<!-- - Can be stated in one sentence -->
<!-- - Involves player agency (not watching) -->
<!-- - Has a clear reinvestment path -->
<!-- - Is inherently repeatable -->
<!-- - Can be prototyped with programmer art -->
<!-- - Is fun with zero content -->

**Validation:** <!-- pass/fail summary against checklist -->

## Aesthetics

<!-- Target experience in plain language, then MDA mapping. -->
<!-- Use MDA framework values: sensation, fantasy, narrative, challenge, -->
<!-- fellowship, discovery, expression, submission -->

Target experience: <!-- aesthetics described naturally -->

MDA mapping: <!-- mechanics → dynamics → aesthetics chain -->

## Key Mechanics

<!-- List each mechanic with a one-line description. -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- - **Grapple** — Launch a hook to swing between platforms and traverse gaps -->
<!-- - **Combat** — Melee and ranged attacks against cave creatures -->

## Scope

<!-- Target scope, platform, input method, and technical constraints. -->

- Target: <!-- jam (48h), micro (1-2wk), small (1-3mo), medium (3-6mo) -->
- Team: <!-- expected team size -->
- Engine: <!-- e.g. godot, unity, bevy, pygame -->
- Platform: <!-- e.g. PC, mobile, web, console --> (<!-- input method -->)

## Design Notes

<!-- Observations from framework enrichment during brainstorm: -->
<!-- - Mashup patterns identified (loop nesting, verb+context shift, etc.) -->
<!-- - Mechanic synergies or tensions -->
<!-- - Risks or known challenges for this genre/scope combination -->
<!-- Omit this section if there are no meaningful observations. -->

## Open Questions

<!-- Anything unresolved or worth revisiting during simulation. -->
<!-- These are deferred ideas, edge cases, or design tensions that -->
<!-- don't need answers yet but should be explored in later phases. -->

## Decision Summary

<!-- Total decisions logged during brainstorm, with origin breakdown. -->
<!-- Example: "12 decisions logged. Origins: 7 user / 3 suggested / 2 inferred" -->
<!-- Detailed log lives in decisions.log -->
