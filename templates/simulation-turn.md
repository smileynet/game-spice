# Turn <NNN>

**Beat:** <!-- First Contact | Learning the Verb | Core Loop in Motion | Rising Stakes | Session End -->
**Focus:** <!-- What this turn explores, e.g. "Player discovers jump mechanic" -->

## What the Player Sees

<!-- ASCII wireframe showing the current screen/moment. -->
<!-- Include an inline legend so the wireframe is self-contained. -->
<!-- See ascii-wireframing skill for conventions; use legend.yaml as source of truth. -->

```
<wireframe>

Legend: <symbol> <meaning>  <symbol> <meaning>  ...
```

## What Is Happening

<!-- Narrative description of the current moment: -->
<!-- - What the player just did (or: this is the start of the session) -->
<!-- - What is on screen and why -->
<!-- - What the player can do next -->
<!-- Be concrete and specific. Describe actions and feedback, not feelings. -->

## Questions

<!-- Specific, concrete questions about how the game should behave in this moment. -->
<!-- These drive design decisions. Ask about undefined behavior, not preferences. -->
<!-- Good: "The player just fell into the pit — do they lose a life, restart the room, or restart the run?" -->
<!-- Bad: "How do you want the game to feel?" -->

## Designer Response

<!-- Filled in after the user answers the questions above. -->
<!-- Capture their words, not your interpretation. -->

## Decisions

<!-- Decisions made this turn, following the Decision Recording Protocol -->
<!-- (see simulation-guide → Decision Recording Protocol for field definitions). -->
<!-- Each decision becomes a row in decisions.log. -->
<!-- date and phase are derived from turn metadata (Beat field above and file creation date). -->

  Rationale: <!-- why -->
  Alternatives: <!-- what was considered -->
